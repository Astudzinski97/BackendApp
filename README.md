Backend Application with ORM using .NET and NHibernate **incomplete**

App stores information of people in database and gives opportunity to manage it using RESTful API
It runs as a self-host using OwinSelfHost, ORM is done with NHibernate, additionaly it uses BasicAuthentication

Unfortunately application is yet to be finished but majority of work is done
